# C++ Best Practice 

A learning exercise for me to find, brush up on, and document best practices for developing high-quality C++ code.

# Setup 

These instructions are for **Windows**:

1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. Install VS Code (on windows)
1. Install Python3
   ```
   sudo apt update && upgrade

   sudo apt install python3-pip -y
   ```
1. Install Jupyter (inside WSL)
   ```
   sudo apt install jupyter -y
   ```
1. Install the remaining dependencies
1. Install Jupyter extension
1. Install C++ extension
1. Install Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    pip install notebook
